# Kaggle competitions
This short file is summary of my kaggle experience, in which companies I competed and how well did I score.
I also segmented the competitions to different areas of machine learning.

### Binary Classification
#### Santander Customer Satisfaction - 816/5236
In this competition, you'll work with hundreds of anonymized features to predict if a customer is satisfied or dissatisfied with their banking experience.

### Multiclass Classification
#### Walmart Recruiting: Trip Type Classification - 120/1047
Walmart is challenging Kagglers to focus on the (data) science and classify customer trips using only a transactional dataset of the items they've purchased.

#### Telstra Network Disruptions - 114/974
Telstra is challenging Kagglers to predict the severity of service disruptions on their network. Using a dataset of features from their service logs,
 you're tasked with predicting if a disruption is a momentary glitch or a total interruption of connectivity.

### Ordinal Classification
#### Prudential Life Insurance Assessment - 154/2619
By developing a predictive model that accurately classifies risk using a more automated approach, you can greatly impact public perception of the industry.
The results will help Prudential better understand the predictive power of the data points in the existing assessment, enabling us to significantly streamline the process.

### Computer Vision
#### State Farm distracted driver detection - ongoing - 169/602
State Farm hopes to improve these alarming statistics, and better insure their customers,
by testing whether dashboard cameras can automatically detect drivers engaging in distracted behaviors. Given a dataset of 2D dashboard camera images,
State Farm is challenging Kagglers to classify each driver's behavior. Are they driving attentively, wearing their seatbelt, or taking a selfie with their friends in the backseat?

#### First steps with Julia - ongoing (getting started) - 5/55
Your model should identify the character in each image in the test set. The possible characters are 'A-Z', 'a-z', and '0-9'.
The predictions will be evaluated using Classification Accuracy.

### NLP
#### Home Depot product search relevance - 720/2125
In this competition, Home Depot is asking Kagglers to help them improve their customers' shopping experience by developing a model that can accurately predict the relevance of search results.

#### 15.071x - The Analytics Edge (Spring 2015) (getting started) - 201/2923
Many blog articles are published each day, and the New York Times has to decide which articles should be featured. In this competition,
we challenge you to develop an analytics model that will help the New York Times understand the features of a blog post that make it popular.

### NP-hard Optimization
#### Santa's Stolen Sleigh - 195/1127
Variation on the multiple traveling salesman problem with non euclidean distance calculation.
